## 📝 NOTE 
File [update_list](scripts/update_list.py) will help to automatically update file [README](README.md) with:
* Add a new solution entry
* Add a new language to an existed solution
* Count solutions

## 🚀 FUTURE PLANS:
- [ ] Handle with other languages (such as python, java,...)
- [ ] Create an app to:
    * [ ] AI assistant: provide suggestions, analyze errors, generate test cases, explain code.
    * [ ] Statistics & Analytics: progress charts, problem counts by difficulty, tags, solving time, accuracy rate, etc.
    * [ ] Search & Filtering: by tags, difficulty, status, language, solving date, etc.
    * [ ] Personal notes & reminders
    * [ ] Practice mode: random problems, set timers
    * [ ] Roadmap: suggest a roadmap with similar problems
